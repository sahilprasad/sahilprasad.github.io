                I was born in Suva, Fiji, have lived most of my life in Sacramento, CA, and am on the East Coast for Brown. 
                To me, computer science is a skillset that I intend to utilization to change the world at the intersection of several 
                disciplines.

                Obviously, I love Iron Man. But this extends to other superheroes as well, namely Batman. In my free time, I enjoy working 
                on personal projects, playing the guitar, dancing, and hanging out with friends. I also enjoy video games, so if you need 
                someone to help you raise your K/D in any Call of Duty ever made, <a title="my psn is @prasadator..." class="main_link">hmu</a>.

                <li>
                    <a class="course">CS17/18 - Integrated Introduction to Computer Science</a>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This was the intermediate introductory sequence offered at Brown for potential computer science concentrators. 
                        We used two functional languages (Racket and OCaml) to learn about basic algorithms, data structures, runtime complexity, etc. 
                        Some examples of projects done for the class are: a Gomoku remake with an A.I. agent, a search engine, a Racket interpreter made in 
                        OCaml, and a server-client system mimicking the controls of Git.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a class="course">CS22 - Discrete Math and Probability</a>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Introductory class that focused on the mathematical theory behind many computer science concepts, although not restrained to them. Topics 
                        included probability, number, and graph theory.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a class="course">CS33 - Introduction to Systems</a>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This class reinforced many of the high-level concepts I had learned thus far in my education with low-level explanations. Using C, we implemented 
                        projects such as a dynamic memory allocator, buffer overflow hack, and several more.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a class="course">CS1270 - Database Management Concepts</a>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CS1270 provided a theoretical backing to my experience with databases, covering topics such as query optimization, B+ trees for index building, 
                        the various normal forms, and much more.</li>
                    </ul>

                <li>
                    <a class="course">CS1300 - User Interface Design</a>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This was the first class I had ever taken focused on the more user-facing aspects of software engineering, and I learned a lot about how best to design 
                        applications to ensure appropriate usage and a satisfactory experience. The final project for the class required us to get into groups and produce an interface 
                        from the ground up. My group's project, <a class="main_link" href="http://www.trypoint.xyz">Point</a>, is a redesign of a typical map interface that is optimized for pedestrians, cyclists, and runners.</li>
